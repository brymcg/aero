Welcome to Aero Financial Partners and thanks for stopping by. This being the first entry, it might make sense to explain who we are and what we are about. It is our opinion that small and medium businesses are underserved, inefficiently served, and even sometimes overserved, by the universe of financial software, back-office systems and third party consultants. This can result in way too much manual content, ineffective business processes or overpaying for services that aren’t necessary. We believe that SMB managers should be spending their time building things or selling things, not dealing with bookkeeping, ERP deployment, procurement or other such activities. 

It is our mission to mitigate this problem by intelligently deploying technology solutions and streamlined business processes. While enterprise software is continually evolving, it can be a very confusing ecosystem and it’s rarely the case that a given solution will precisely fit a business’s needs. With expertise in enterprise software, data automation and custom app development, we can give you exactly what you need without any waste. And by incorporating the principles of Lean, we can do it a way that minimizes churn in your business. 

So what does this mean for you in reality? If you find yourself spending more time than you’d prefer dealing with things like monthly closing, Salesforce customization, audit management, financial reporting, etc consider letting us help. We can handle it in an economical, targeted way. If you’re curious for more specifics, check out our case studies. 

Thanks and looking forward to working with you.

Bryan
